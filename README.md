# AudioLibSwitcher

The purpose of this repository is to be an interface-based layer between different audio libraries so that you can easily switch between different audio libs.

The reason for such a solution is because different libs come under different licenses and you might realize that you one library doesn't suit your project because of license mismatch. This interface will allow you to then easily unplug-plug-and-play and use the library that best work for you without having to rewrite a lot of code in your project.
